Part experiment to play with setting up OAuth via command line, part app to
make twitter a better place :P

Re tweets ARE REALLY ANNOYING. If I wanted to read other peoples tweets, I would
subscribe to to their feed. I think it's akin to forwarding emails to all your friends
because you find them amusing. THey really aren't.

When this is finished, if you run the program, it'll download all of your
tweets, and look for retweets. Any use that retweets more than 3 times in a
day will be unfollowed.

So far, only the OAuth, and parsing stuff is done - the next bit is to actually
write the counting and unfollow code.

Anywoo - you'll need the twitter gem: http://twitter.rubyforge.org/ and the
sqlite3 gem (eventually - one the counting stuff is done)

To Run:

% ruby retweet_this

and follow the instructions :)
